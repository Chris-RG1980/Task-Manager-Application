# Task-Manager-Application
Data Centric Design Mini-Project
***
Welcome to the **Data Centric Design mini-project**. In this project, we're going to create a task manager application using Flask, MongoDB, and a frontend framework called Materialize.

## Learning Outcomes
- Perform **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) calls** to a MongoDB database within a Flask application.
- Create HTML-based user interfaces to demonstrate these CRUD calls in action.
- Style these interfaces using the Materialize framework for a good user experience.

## Project Overview
The task manager application we're going to build together will have the following features:

1. **Home Page**: Displays a summary of tasks including task name, due date, urgency status, task category, description, and creator.

2. **User Authentication and Authorization**: Users can register, view their profile, log out, and log back in. Registered users can add new tasks, edit their tasks, and delete their tasks. However, users can only edit and delete their own tasks.

3. **Task Management**: Users can add a new task, select a due date using Materialize's date picker component, and toggle a switch to mark the task as urgent.

4. **Search Function**: A basic search function will be built to filter tasks based on the user's query.

5. **Task Categories Management**: Admin users can manage the task categories list.

6. **Responsive Design**: The application will be fully responsive by using Materialize's grid-based classes.
